##### `count` *{`Optional[int]`}*
The total number of results in your Belvo account.
<br/>
**Example:** `130`

---
##### `next` *{`Optional[str]`}*
The URL to next page of results. Each page consists of up to 100 items. If there are not enough results for an additional page, the value is `null`.

In our documentation example, we use `{endpoint}` as a placeholder value. In production, this value will be replaced by the actual endpoint you are currently using (for example, `accounts` or `owners`).

<br/>
**Example:** `https://sandbox.belvo.com/api/{endpoint}/?page=2`

---
##### `previous` *{`Optional[str]`}*
The URL to the previous page of results. If there is no previous page, the
value is `null`.

<br/>
**Example:** `null`

---
##### `results` *{`List[PaymentTransaction]`}*
Array of transaction objects.
