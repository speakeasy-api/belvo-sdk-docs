##### `ready_to_confirm` *{`Optional[bool]`}*
Boolean that indicates whether the payment intent is ready to be confirmed. This value will return: 

  \- `false` when a customer wants to pay for the very first time. This is so because you still need to input information about your customer in the following steps to process a payment successfully. 
  \- `true` when a customer wants to pay and this is not their first time. This is so because the payment intent has all the information needed about the customer to process a payment. 


\*\*Note:\*\* When the value is `true`, you'll need to confirm the payment intent. You can do this by making a PATCH request sending through the parameter `confirm: true`.

<br/>
**Example:** `true`

---
##### `type` *{`Optional[NextStepDisplayTokenRequiredPseType]`}*
The type of `next_step` you need to follow.

<br/>
**Example:** `pse_display_token_required`
<Collapsible content={() => import('/content/models/shared/next_step_display_token_required_pse_type/python.mdx')}>
</Collapsible>
