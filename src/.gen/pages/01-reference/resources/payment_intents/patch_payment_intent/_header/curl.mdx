Complete a new payment intent.


During the payment intent flow, you need to fill in the payment intent with required information about your customer (their institution, bank account, and login credentials). This is done by sending PATCH requests with the information that Belvo asked you display in each `next_step` object. If you need more information on how to complete a payment intent, check our <a href="https://developers.belvo.com/docs/colombia-pse#payment-intents" target="_blank">PSE payment initiation</a> guides for  ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombia.
